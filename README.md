The program code for applying the DRFP Algorithm to a 3-D chaotic seed system to automatically generate the chaotic nest-fold system. 
In MATLAB R2019a environment, by configuring different number of folds `n1', `n2', `m1',and `l1', the live script file *.mlx will automatically generate corresponding system equations.
Or paste the code in command window to generate editable equation for simulation study.
